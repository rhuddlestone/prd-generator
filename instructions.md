# Important Implementation Notes
## 0. Adding logs
   - Always add server side logs to your code so we can debug any potential issues

## 1. Project setup
   - All new components should go in /components at the root (not in the app folder) and be named like example-component.tsx unless otherwise specified
   - All new pages go in /app
   - Use the Next.js 14 app router
   - All data fetching should be done in a server component and pass the data down as props
   - Client components (useState, hooks, etc) require that 'use client' is set at the top of the file

## 2. Server-Side API Calls:
   - All interactions with external APIs (e.g., Reddit, OpenAI) should be performed server-side.
   - Create dedicated API routes in the `pages/api` directory for each external API interaction.
   - Client-side components should fetch data through these API routes, not directly from external APIs.

## 3. Environment Variables:
   - Store all sensitive information (API keys, credentials) in environment variables.
   - Use a `.env.local` file for local development and ensure it's listed in `.gitignore`.
   - For production, set environment variables in the deployment platform (e.g., Vercel).
   - Access environment variables only in server-side code or API routes.

## 4. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling in both client-side components and server-side API routes.
   - Log errors on the server-side for debugging purposes.
   - Display user-friendly error messages on the client-side.

## 5. Type Safety:
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures, especially API responses.
   - Avoid using `any` type; instead, define proper types for all variables and function parameters.

## 6. API Client Initialization:
   - Initialize API clients (e.g., Snoowrap for Reddit, OpenAI) in server-side code only.
   - Implement checks to ensure API clients are properly initialized before use.

## 7. Data Fetching in Components:
   - Use React hooks (e.g., `useEffect`) for data fetching in client-side components.
   - Implement loading states and error handling for all data fetching operations.

## 8. Next.js Configuration:
   - Utilize `next.config.mjs` for environment-specific configurations.
   - Use the `env` property in `next.config.mjs` to make environment variables available to the application.

## 9.  CORS and API Routes:
   - Use Next.js API routes to avoid CORS issues when interacting with external APIs.
   - Implement proper request validation in API routes.

## 10. Component Structure:
   - Separate concerns between client and server components.
   - Use server components for initial data fetching and pass data as props to client components.

## 11. Security:
    - Never expose API keys or sensitive credentials on the client-side.
    - Implement proper authentication and authorization for API routes if needed.

## 12. Special syntax:
   - When use shadcn, use npx shadcn@latest add xxx, instead of shadcn-ui@latest, this is deprecated
